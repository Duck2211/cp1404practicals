## Practical 10
Throughout the whole semester, I believed that my accuracy is decent and it has been improving more and more overtime with the work of practical. Despite of that, I still have alot of improvement to do

From code reviewing, I have learnt more about how to give a good feedback and also compliment to people. Similarly, I also learnt how to take in the feedback from other people and improve my code after that.

If I am in charge of the subject, I would add a group project and probably not have a paper test.
