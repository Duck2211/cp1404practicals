 Things I have learned so far in this subject in terms of "clean code"

1: I have learned to make my code as simple as possible so others can fully understand my code properly without to look deep

2: I have learned that having functions, and classes make the code very clear and clean coding.

3: I have learned that having a good and easy to read variable/descriptive name for the code can sometimes make the code itself better to read for others.
